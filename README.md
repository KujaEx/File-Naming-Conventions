# File-Naming-Conventions
A website for helping to generate names for research data files.

Link: https://kujaex.github.io/File-Naming-Conventions/

This website (WIP) will have a form for many attributes which can be part of a file name (e.g. author, release date, title, category etc.). After submitting the attributes a file name will be constructed following many naming convention rules (e.g. order of attributes, no capital letters, no special signs, underscores instead of spaces, schema of timestamps etc.).

List of examples for content of file name:
* title
* author
* organisation
* date (release or date processed)
* version (e.g. v03)
* ...

List of technical conventions and restrictions:
* no special signs (e.g., * . ” / \ [ ] : ; | = , < ? > & $ # ! ‘( ) { })
* no umlaut marks or similar signs, transforming to a substitute (e.g. ä -> ae, ß -> ss, é -> e)
* underscores instead of spaces
* maximum length (with pathname) of 256 characters
* standard formats (e.g. timestamp with YYYYMMDD)
